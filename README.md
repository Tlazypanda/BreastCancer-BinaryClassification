# BreastCancer-BinaryClassification   

This aims to classify breast cancer tumours benign(non- cancerous) or malignent(cancerous) based on 5 factors mean area,mean smoothness,mean perimeter,mean radius,mean texture.This is obtained on examining a breast cancer cell from FNA technique.  

This makes use of a neural network with 3 hidden layers.The model currently has accuracy of 88%.The binary cross entropy loss function and adam optimizer is used.  

Scikit learn's cross val score function is used to predict accuracy.
